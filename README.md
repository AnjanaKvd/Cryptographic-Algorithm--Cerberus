The Three "Heads" of Cerberus
2.2.1 The S-Box (Substitution)
The S-Box is a lookup table that substitutes each character in a
block with another character from a predefined set. This is a nonlinear operation that creates confusion. Our S-Box is
deterministically generated by shuffling a defined character set
using a fixed seed, ensuring the same S-Box is produced every time.
2.2.2 The P-Box (Permutation)
The P-Box rearranges the positions of characters within a block. It does not change the
characters themselves, only their order. This diffuses the plaintext patterns, making statistical
analysis more difficult. Our P-Box uses a fixed permutation rule that is easily reversible for
decryption.
2.2.3 The Key Scheduler
The Key Scheduler takes a single 8-character master key and generates a unique round key for
the initial step and for each of the four rounds. This is achieved through a simple cyclic left shift,
where the key is rotated by one position for each subsequent round. This prevents the same key
from being used in every round, which increases security.

2.3 Key Mixing Operation
To combine the text block with a round key, we use modular addition. Each character from the
block and the key is converted to its index in the character set. These indices are added together,
and the result modulo the size of the character set gives a new index, which is then converted
back to a character. This method was chosen over a bitwise XOR to ensure that all intermediate
results remain valid, printable characters from our defined set.
